<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>I have jusst happen to have a passion for coding and 
so I decided to put it together in a site.  I did not 
want to do it unless it was simple.  The messages come 
across easier when things are simpler.  I think there is 
a real misunderstanding about features that people push on.
They then come to the realization you dont need all of that. :(
</p>

<p>But simplicity is hard.  You have to understand the tech at 
the ground level to be able to simplify things.  </p>

<p>I believe Rob Pike really drives this point home.</p>
